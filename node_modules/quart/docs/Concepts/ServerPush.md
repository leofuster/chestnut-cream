# Server Push
Server push is a significant enhancing feature of HTTP/2 that enables a server to send known set of possible future requests or any other request without the client explicitly requesting for them. **Quart** simplifies this process by creating fully reusable handles that can be pushed to the client.

## Async push and caveats
In HTTP/2 support for push is not compulsory. In some cases the client may elect to not support server push and in **Quart**'s API this will be automatically handled for you. `SubStream#push` is an asynchronous function that returns a boolean indicating whether or not the route was pushed to the client.

```javascript
app.handle('/index.html', async (stream) => {
  const wasPushed = await stream.push('/bundle.js', {
    'content-type': 'application/json'
  });

  // ...

  stream.sendFile('./build/index.html');
});

app.handle('/bundle.js', async (stream) => stream.sendFile('./build/bundle.js'));
```
