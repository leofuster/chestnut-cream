# Exception handling
Exceptions handling within Async function is as simple as throwing a normal error.

```javascript
app.handle('/', async (stream) => {
  if (!stream.query.user) throw new Error("Bad request");
  // ...
});
```


For security reasons the content of errors are not exposed to the client unless a special type of error known as `SafeError` is thrown. `Quart#SafeError` is expose as a static value when importing **Quart** or through the instance:

```javascript
const Quart = require('quart');
const { SafeError } = Quart;
const app = new Quart({ /* ... */ });

app.handle('/', async (stream) => {
  if (!stream.query.user) throw new SafeError("Invalid user id", 400);

  const user = await Users.find(stream.query.id);
  if (!user) throw new SafeError("User not found", 404);
  // ...
});
```
