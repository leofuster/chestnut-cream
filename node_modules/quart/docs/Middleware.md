## Writing a middleware

Middleware are special handles in **Quart** that allow for interception of streams and are executed before the handles are hit. A stream may not be open when the middleware is called.

```javascript
app.use(async (stream, next) => {
  console.log({ method: stream.method });
  await next();
  console.log("Done");
});
```

- *Middleware can be called via internal requests (push).*
- *Middleware don't map into a path/route.*
