# Pseudo Headers in HTTP/2
HTTP/2 is a multiplexing, binary protocol. Requests are therefore made within the same connection and are decorated with Pseudo Headers ([defined in 8.1.2.1 Pseudo-Header Fields](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540#section-8.1.2.1)) indicating several pieces of information along with other request headers carried forward from HTTP/1.1 

*Note that Pseudo Headers only apply to requests and must not be sent with response headers.*

## Request Pseudo Headers
For more information [refer to 8.1.2.3. Request Pseudo-Header Fields](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540#section-8.1.2.3).

`:method` - Indicates method (GET, POST, PUT, ...) for the incoming request.

`:scheme` - Scheme of the URI (HTTP, HTTPS), note that this is not limited to HTTP(S) depending on the service schema.

`:authority` - Replaces host in HTTP/1.1

`:path` - Path and query of the request (e.g. `/api?id=x`)
