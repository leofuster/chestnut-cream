# Server Push in HTTP/2
Another significant feature of HTTP/2 is the addition of Server Push. Traditionally in HTTP/1.1 resources were sent according to the requests and only to fulfill that particular requests, in HTTP/2 the server and client can elect to allow for server to push resources to the client without an explicit requests.

## Possible Usecases
### Serving followup dependencies
Dependencies and followup assets can be served to the client before they are requested. This is often represented by showcasing `index.html -> favicon.ico` requests.

### Lazy preloading assets
Assets that are required by the current requests can be pushed to the client with ease. Let's assume that we have removed our spriting builds for image assets to leverage multiplexing but want to preload them to the client in a lazy way to avoid [Flash Of Content](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_of_unstyled_content), we can push a part of our bundle to the client when the client requests for a particular asset.
