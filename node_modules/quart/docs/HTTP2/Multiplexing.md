# Multiplexing with HTTP/2
Traditionally with HTTP/1.1 only a single request and stream was transmitted per connection. Although `Keep-Alive` header has been part of the HTTP/1.1 specs, it suffered from several issues including [Head-of-line blocking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head-of-line_blocking) and [sequencing issues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_pipelining) that only made pipelining GET requests effective.

These issues have been addressed in HTTP/2 through multiplexing by effectively handling asynchronous requests over a single TCP connection. 
Multiplexing is one of the main highlights of HTTP/2.

## Reduced latency and improved parallelism
Multiplexing unblocks the limitations of pipelining for the client and allows for multiple requests to be parallelized on the same connection. The cost of connection is also reduced as the client and server do not need to establish a TCP connection per request reducing latency that would otherwise be affected by handshakes required to establish the connections.

## Say Goodbye to bundling and spriting
Bundling assets and JS files, spriting images and domain sharding have been pillars of performance optimizations with HTTP/1.1, Multiplexing allows for the requests of multiple files to be bundled into a single stream effectively creating a bundle on the fly. 

*Note that although unbundling all assets would be substantially better with HTTP/2, in cases of a significant number of requests the stream may lose compression quality compared to traditional bundling but the benefits of HTTP/2 multiplexing when done correctly and on a reasonable scale outway much of the costs.*
